# Nornir_Labs
In this repo I'm exploring Nornir and its plugins, such as Scrapli, NetMiko, NAPALM, etc. For further info, please see the README file.

  The labs are based on a simple topology described in the Topology V1 PNG file.<br>
  Routers are Cisco CSR1000v.<br>
  Each router has its interface GigabitEthernet 1 dedicated to the OOBM function.<br>
  The OOBM addresses are 10.10.10.31 ... 10.10.10.37 respectively to the Router number [R1-R7].<br>
  The automation machine is an Ubuntu desktop running LTS 20.04.<br>
